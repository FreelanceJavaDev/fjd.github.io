## Current Side Projects
I have a few side projects that aren't on Github for various reasons.

However two I'm currently working on are a pure C/C++ webserver using ANSI C and standard C++11 libraries and reverse engineering a unique game engine called "GeoMod".  

The server isn't ready for public use due to the current state of development, functionality and lack of security. It's currently on hold while I'm developing a Javascript to C++ compiler for quick feature implementation.

The GeoMod engine is a literal black box, like any good engineer I want to open the black box and see how it works.  Currently it's just a disassembled binary that was originally C++.  While the game engine was used it was only used fully a couple of times.  The original company who developed it folded and since the game is from 2001 the engine needs an update to be useful.  It's different than other game engines in that it allows unscripted level geometry modification.



## Interests
I develop software, but I enjoy the odd analog circuit every now and then. I like hardware-software projects. 

I also enjoy taking apart old electronics for parts in future projects and fixing vintage electronics.

My main interest is in custom robotics, but as a Gamer I'm interested in building my own version of VR gloves and headset.


## Employers

For employers I mostly have public githubs, however some of my work is in private githubs.  I don't take requests, I invite you, and only for a limited time.  These are files that contain personally identifable information about me.  I don't want that fully exposed on the internet.  That's another reason I use FJD as a my programmer handle for my personal projects.

However I strongly encourage looking at my Arduino Data Logger, that was some volunteer work I was doing for Sandwich STEM academy on Cape Cod. I consider that my finest finished project.  It was written and developed to be adaptable, modular, extendable, reliable and easy to use while minimizing memory usage.  I added HTML documentation so any beginners could understand and use the code.
