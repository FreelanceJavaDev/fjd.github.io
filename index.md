## Current Side Projects
I have a few side projects that aren't on Github for various reasons.

However two I'm currently working on are a pure C/C++ webserver using ANSI C and standard C++11 libraries and reverse engineering a unique game engine called "GeoMod".  

The server isn't ready for public use due to the current state of development, functionality and lack of security. It's currently on hold while I'm developing a Javascript to C++ compiler for quick feature implementation.  But the promising memory and connection speed improvments are remarkable.  This server can run on a Raspberry Pi B+ and that thing takes 1/6 the power of a lightbulb, has the foot print of a credit card add on that it's only $25 now and that's one small and cheap server!

The GeoMod engine is a literal black box, like any good engineer I want to open the black box and see how it works.  Currently it's just a disassembled binary that was originally C++.  While the game engine was used it was only used fully a couple of times.  The original company who developed it folded and since the game is from 2001 the engine needs an update to be useful.  It's different than other game engines in that it allows unscripted level geometry modification.

Both of these projects are come from the same root cause.  Curiosity... A black box is in front of me.  If I'm told nobody knows what's inside and nobody cares. The first thing I want to do is smash that box with a hammer and see what's inside.  Sometimes I want something inside the box, sometimes I just want to find out how it works so I can understand the broader relationship to the wider concept.  Sometimes I find that in learning the nuts and bolts of how something works, but do it in a different way that just by doing it differently makes it more efficent then I have even more fun by disrupting the established "normal" ways of doing things simply because it is easier instead of better.


## Interests
I develop software, but I enjoy the odd analog circuit every now and then. I like hardware-software projects. 

I also enjoy taking apart old electronics for parts in future projects and fixing vintage electronics.

My main interest is in custom robotics, but as a Gamer I'm interested in building my own version of VR gloves and headset.



## Employers

For employers I mostly have public githubs, however some of my work is in private githubs.  I don't take requests, I invite you, and only for a limited time.  These are files that contain personally identifable information about me.  I don't want that fully exposed on the internet.  That's another reason I use FJD as a my programmer handle for my personal projects.  The other reason for that user name is I made it a long time ago, but the name stuck after I found this at my house:

However I strongly encourage looking at my Arduino Data Logger, that was some volunteer work I was doing for Sandwich STEM academy on Cape Cod. I consider that my finest finished project.  It was written and developed to be adaptable, modular, extendable, reliable and easy to use while minimizing memory usage.  I added HTML documentation so any beginners could understand and use the code.
